            <h1>Ace of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Framed by a thin black line drawn about 1/8” from the edge of a 2-3/4” x 4-3/4” card, a large white hand is depicted emerging from a swirling gray gaseous form, grasping the hilt of a sword and holding the blade straight up, the point of which is encircled by a golden crown draped with two sprays of green foliage.</p>
        <p>Holding the card so that the shorter sides make up the top and bottom, a 2-1/2” x 1/3” rectangular space is observed stretching horizontally along the bottom edge of the card. This space is set within and shares three sides (left, right, and bottom) of the previously referenced black border and is enclosed on the top by a fourth thin black line. Inside these lines, the space is colored gray and contains the inscription “ACE of SWORDS,” followed by a dot. Just to the right of the dot, outside the black border, and running vertically along what is now identifiable as the right edge of the card, the copyright symbol, &copy;, followed by the year “1971” and the proper noun “U.S. Games” appears in relatively small print. These are the only markings on the card that exist in the white space outside of the black border, as well as the only ones that appear to be computer generated instead of hand drawn. </p>
        <p>Returning to the space inside the original black border, four jagged lines run more or less parallel (left to right, or west to east) along the line bordering the top edge of the gray rectangular space at the bottom of the image. Each line varies in length and also appears to slope up and down at erratic intervals, creating a series of irregularly shaped spaces and establishing depth in the visual field. The spaces within the lines that establish foreground and background share the same light blue coloring of the area in between, yet differ in that a burnt orange shade is layered on top. At their tallest points, the lines peak ½” from the bottom border of the image (which is the top edge of the rectangular space containing the inscription); at their lowest, they dip 1/8” from the same. </p> 
        <p>Camouflaged in the lower right (southeastern) corner of the image is the staff of a tall, thin letter “P” which intersects a vertically compressed, horizontally elongated letter “C” and continues down through a similarly proportioned capital “S” with an embellished curve of the tail. The tail of the “P” extends two millimeters further below the “S”, beside which is a small black dot, and connects with the bottom border of the image. This is presumably the artist’s signature. </p>
        <p>The central object of this image is that of a large hand holding a sword. It is surrounded by negative space that is shaded the same color gray as the interior of the rectangular space containing the inscription. This shade of gray is a lighter than the color of the gaseous form that introduces the hand, drawn flush along the mid-western border. </p>
        <p>A swirling mass extends about two inches lengthwise and projects ¾” into the center of the image from the edge where it first appears; its point of origin is not depicted. A forearm extends from the bottom of the gas and measures in length about 1-1/4” from the top of the wrist to the top of the middle finger’s knuckle. The back of the hand is depicted wrapped around the grip of a long sword, so that only the first knuckles of the four fingers are shown and the thumb appears indistinctly behind the grip. The hand is shaded white with a sunburst of short lines (the same color as the hand itself) drawn around its periphery. </p>
        <p>The grip of the sword, long enough for one hand’s breadth (in this case about ¾”), is shaded light blue with white accents and ridged with thin black horizontal lines. Below the hand, the grip ends in a circular pommel, also predominantly blue with a hint of white. Above the hand, situated perpendicularly to the hilt, the corners of a rectangular cross-guard flare out slightly. Above the cross-guard at the base of the blade, a trapezoidal ricasso extends the grip an extra 1/3,” above which the central ridge forks, splitting the blade down the middle and creating two sharp edges. The right side of the blade is shaded blue while the left is white; it is about 2-1/4” long, or nearly half the length of the entire card. </p>
        <p>Two groups of three small, yellow flame-shaped images appear to hover slantwise in mid air just above the ricasso, one group on either side of the blade. </p>
        <p>Encircling the blade just 1/3” from the point is a yellow circlet (the same color as the flame-shaped images) decorated with five evenly spaced red dots. The circlet is fitted with a band just slightly larger than itself, which flares intermittently into a concentric series of molded floral designs consisting of five petals blooming around a red dot in the center. Two such ornaments are visible and situated on either side of the point of the blade. Two more are partially obscured by the presence of two sprays of green foliage draped over the edge of the circlet to hang down on either side of the blade, balanced in this position by their yellow stems which are seen suspended inside the circlet, hanging parallel to the branches of leaves. Falcate shaped leaves, seamlessly joined along the base of a 1-1/2” branch, hang down in mid-air along the right side; and to the left hangs a branch sprouting distinct, shorter elliptical blades interspersed with six more red dots. The color of both sprays is a yellowish-green and they both appear to be outlined in the same shade of yellow as the circlet and the flame-shapes below. </p>
