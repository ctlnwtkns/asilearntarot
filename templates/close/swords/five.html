            <h1>Five of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The sky, or that which is visible between grey clouds, is colored a pale blue - lighter than the blue of the only other card, thus far examined, featuring a similarly colored sky – the Two of Swords. The sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the background, ceding a significant area to the light grey clouds stretching diagonally across this space. These shapes, outlined in black, and marked with closely spaced, thin white lines, slope up from bottom left to top right at an approximate 35-degree angle to the horizon.</p> 
        <p>Compared to the clouds in the Three of Swords, with their scalloped edges and billowy sense of fullness, the clouds pictured here are jagged and flat, parallel to each other, and spaced so as to divide the sky into roughly four parts. </p>
        <p>Although the shape and color remain consistent, the clouds vary is size. There are four clouds depicted, three of which bisect the western edge of the card, only one of these stretching all the way across the top of the image to connect with the eastern border just below the top-right corner. The fourth cloud, relatively small in comparison, is seen leaving the image at the upper-middle edge of the eastern border. </p>
        <p>Three densely shaded areas in the shape of hills demarcate the edge of the horizon, where the body of water meets the sky. There are two hills towards the west and one, just barely visible, along the eastern border.  Of the two in the west, the one furthest from the border is outlined in white and the face of the hill visible from the shore is shaded the same pale grey as the clouds above. </p>
        <p>Of the remaining one-third of the background, the upper half depicts a body of water, very similar to the background in the Two of Swords in that the near shore is a smooth grey surface and the far shore appears to be a hilly landscape; different, however, in that there are no land masses emerging from the water in the Five as compared to the Two, and the blue water of the Five is shaded a brownish-purple, perhaps to reflect the grey clouds above, whereas both water and sky in the Two are uniformly blue.</p>
        <p>The lower half appears to be exactly the same as in the Two, except for in relative proportion, with slightly more space being dedicated to the ground in the Two despite there being two additional figures in the Five.</p> 
        <p> The Five of Swords is the only card examined so far that depicts more than one figure; all three pictured here appear to be male. </p>
        <p>The main figure is wearing yellow boots, which reach to his mid-calf, over red tights, with a green tunic over a red undergarment. The second figure appears to be wearing the same costume but in different colors – white boots, yellow tights, a predominantly yellow tunic, shaded red at the sleeves and near the hem of the skirt (although belted, whereas the main figure’s is not), over a green undergarment. Additionally, this second figure has a red mantle draped over his right shoulder. The costume of the third figure would seem to resemble those of the first two, however distinction in color is lost, as he is too small to warrant much detail. Hazarding a guess, his boots and tunic appear to be yellow (where they are not shaded black), while the tights look white.</p>
        <p>The foreground figure’s brightly colored yellow and orange hair appears to be supported by some force other than gravity; what could be shoulder-length when lying flat and hanging down, is standing up off this person’s neck at an angle similar to the cloud above his head. In both color and shape, his hair is reminiscent of the celestial figures’ hair in both The Lovers and Judgment, and noteworthy in its distinction from the hair on either head of the other two figures displayed on this card. The crown of the second largest figure’s head is visible and colored yellow; the third and smallest figure’s head is simply a dark shape in the distance with no discernible features.</p>
        <p>The foreground figure is facing west and his face is seen in profile, the left side on display. The shape of his face is very angular, his nose and chin protrude distinctly from an otherwise relatively flat edge. His mouth is closed and set in a straight line, although slightly upturned at the corner.  From the direction and angle his head is turned, his gaze seems to be directed over his right shoulder at the retreating figure behind him to the west. As already noted, the third figure’s face is not depicted, although the position of his head relative to his back and shoulders suggests that his chin is tilted down as though he is hanging his head.</p>
        <p>The foreground figure is positioned with his left foot pointing due west and his right foot pointing into the lower right corner of the card. His feet seem to be planted squarely beneath his broad shoulders, giving him a wide and open stance. His hips are aligned with his stance and he appears to be turning to his right slightly at the waist. As previously mentioned, he is looking over his right shoulder. His right arm is extended down and he is holding the hilt of a sword, which is pointed down, loosely in his right hand between the crook of his thumb, pointer, and middle fingers.  His left arm is bent at the elbow and he is cupping the pommels of two swords in his left hand, their hilts level with his stomach, blades resting against his chest and pointing up over his left shoulder. </p>
        <p>The second largest figure appears to be on the move, as his right foot is pointed forward and in front of his left. Only his backside is visible, as he is facing the water. His left arm appears to be bent at the elbow and his left hand is not visible. The mantle draped over his right shoulder obscures his right arm completely. </p>
        <p>The third and smallest figure is standing with his feet together, facing the water but not directly confronting it. His right arm is visible, bent at the elbow, his shoulders are a bit rounded, and his head is bowed, giving the impression that he might be holding his head in his hand. </p>
        <p>The foreground figure is much larger than the two behind him; he occupies the right half and lower two thirds of the whole card. The retreating figure is just less than half this size, and the third and smallest figure is half this size again. Generally, the eastern half of the card is dedicated to the figure in the foreground and the background figures occupy the western half.  </p>
        <p>The figure in the foreground seems to be in possession of all five swords – three in hand and two on the ground at his feet. In color and shape, these swords resemble those described in the Ace, Two, and Three (bearing a resemblance in shape, but not color to the swords described in the Four). The position of the swords in hand has already been described, although it should be noted that the point of the blade in his right hand is not depicted. In fact, the points of all swords connected with the ground are not depicted, only those of the swords pointing toward the sky. </p>
        <p>There is one sword lying on the ground in front of the figure cutting across the lower left corner of the card. The retreating figure’s left heel is drawn so as to be nearly touching this sword’s crossguard (although considerably smaller, thereby indicating significant distance between the two). The other sword is laid out behind the foreground figure, the right edge of the crossguard touching his right foot, and the blade extending about two-thirds the length of the card along the ground and intersecting the eastern border of the image just above the artist’s signature, which is in the lower right corner just above the foreground figure’s left foot.</p>
