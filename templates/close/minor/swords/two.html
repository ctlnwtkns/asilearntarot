            <h1>Two of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The central figure in this card is a blind-folded person seated on a gray bench, arms crossed at the chest, holding a silver sword in each hand.</p>
        <p>The ground under the person’s feet is unmarked and colored gray. This space measures approximately 7/8” X 2-1/2” and comprises the smallest of three main backgrounds areas. </p>
        <p>The second and slightly larger (1-1/4” X 2-1/2”) area just above the gray ground is colored a bright shade of blue and heavily marked with broken black lines running parallel to each other and perpendicular to the seated figure, suggesting the presence of a body of water. </p>
        <p>In the lower left corner of this second area the lines are darker, heavier, and longer, and the space between them is predominantly shaded yellow giving way to blue. In the lower right corner on the other side of the seated figure the presence of the lines is also denser, although less so than on the left, and there is no yellow coloring. </p>
        <p>Level with the seated figure’s mid section, two lumpy ***  Rising out of the water at the edge of the horizon and running the majority of the length of the drawing (2-2/3”) a jagged line gradually gains and loses elevation at irregular intervals creating a space the area of which is colored yellow, denoting a land mass where the water meets the sky.</p>
        <p>This area is the third and largest portion of the background (2-1/4” X 2-1/2”) and is colored a slightly duller shade of blue than the water below. The sky remains unmarked except for the presence of a yellow semicircle suspended about 7/16” below the upper border and 9/16” from the right edge, opening around the southwestern quarter indicating that it is the moon in its new crescent phase. </p>
        <p>Up and to the left of the moon, the Roman numeral “II” is centered at the top of the card 1-1/8” from both sides and just 1/16” below the border.</p> <p>Returning to the bottom of the image, the stone bench is the same color gray as the ground on which it sits, and is aligned with the “II” to be positioned in the center of the card equidistant from the left and right borders. </p>
        <p>As a foreground image, the bench is situated close to the upper edge of the rectangular space that makes the ground so that it is framed for the most part by water in the background. The base of the bench is 1” X 7/16” and the seat is just slightly longer, creating a pedestal-like effect. </p>
        <p>The figure seated on the bench is of androgynous gender, clothed in an unembroidered, off-white (nearly but not exactly the same color as the bench and ground), loose-fitting, long-sleeved kirtle. Only her feet, hands, neck, and hair remain exposed; her skin is a golden yellow hue with a light dusting of red over the right half of her face, neck, and fingers of her right hand. Her feet are colored a different shade of yellow than her skin and lack any apparent detail such as toes. She wears her black hair short and her bangs appear to be trapped beneath a blindfold, which is wrapped around her head and covering her eyes. She sits erect, legs open and feet planted apart. Her arms are bent at the elbows and her forearms are crossed at the wrist over her chest. Her mouth is closed and straight-lipped. She grips a sword by the hilt in each hand, blades extended up at a 45-degree angle.
        </p>
        <p>The points are blunted as they intersect with the black border about 7/8” from the top of the card and level with the crescent moon. The swords share several characteristics with the Ace of Swords, namely they both appear to be double-edged and colored silver shaded blue along the outer edge (outer in this case being the edge furthest from her face). The cross-guards, which flank each shoulder, are simply rectangular without being flared at the corners, and the pommel, if present, is covered completely by her hands. The angle of the swords divides the sky into three triangular sections, and only the middle section contains objects, those being the figure’s head, the moon, and the Roman numeral II. </p>
