            <h1>Three of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Three swords pierce the center of a large red heart suspended in mid air beneath pale stormy clouds pelting rain into an empty gray sky.</p>
        <p>The central image, positioned in the foreground and located equidistant to the black border on all four sides, is a large, bright red heart outlined with a heavy black line. It measures about 1-7/16” from top to bottom and 1-3/8” side to side at its widest point. The face of the heart is unmarked except for three short lines closely spaced together in a “V” shape in the upper middle area to indicate the points of entry where three swords sliced through the surface. </p>
        <p>Unlike the swords in the Ace or Two, these three blades, lodged in the heart, point downwards. The double edge of the center sword pierces the heart vertically, dividing it in half. Slightly above and flanking the center sword, the other two blades stab the heart at 45 degree angles so that the point of the sword on the left cuts through the heart to emerge behind and to the right, and vice versa. The blades penetrate the heart from the front and emerge behind. The intersection of the blades where they presumably cross paths on their way through the heart is not depicted through the opaque red.  </p>
        <p>The basic structure and color of these swords resembles that of the Ace. One apparent difference, however, is that all three blades lose their central ridge and are uniformly shaded the same light blue from where they emerge behind the heart to their points. </p>
        <p>Above the heart, the Roman numeral “III” is centered at the top of the card ¼” from the pommel of the middle sword. The upper third of the sky features solid black lines which divide a pale gray space into three distinct clouds, irregularly shaped and variously sized. The middle cloud is the largest of the three, occupying the northeastern corner and expanding voluminously along the northern border of the image and down toward the heart. This cloud provides the background for the grips of two swords – the one in the middle and the one, from the viewer’s perspective, to its right.  The second largest cloud hangs behind the first in the northwestern corner of this image and contains the grip of the sword left of center. The third and smallest cloud is crowded into the northeastern corner and clinging, just below it, to the upper-mid section of the eastern border. The interior space of the clouds, like the heart, is unmarked and uniformly shaded a slightly paler color gray than the sky below.  A short scalloped line connecting the northwestern cloud to the heart appears to indicate the presence of a fourth cloud blending into the darker sky.</p>
        <p>Long, thin black lines drawn parallel at an angle in groups of two, three, or four issue forth from the clouds around the heart and swords. They appear to be sheets of rain. As a background feature, the rain does not fall across the face of the heart and, in fact, does not come into contact with the heart at all. That is, except for one line connected to the heart near the exit point of the sword driven through at a southwesterly angle. Similarly, the swords seem to repel the rain, with the exception of two black lines connected to the blade just referenced and just west of and parallel to the line connected to the heart. </p>
