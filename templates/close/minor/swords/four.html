            <h1>Four of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>A stained-glass window occupies the upper left (northwestern) corner of this card. It depicts two figures. The one on the left appears to be seated on a dais and is wearing a robe of red and blue piecework with a red collar and long white bell sleeves ending at the wrist over a yellow tunic. This figure’s right arm is outstretched; its index and middle fingers are fully extended while the ring and pinkie fingers curve in toward the palm (thumb not depicted) in a gesture of blessing or benediction. The figure wears no headdress or covering, although the glass pieces arranged in a halo behind its head are uniformly yellow and inscribed with the letters P-A-X. Only the skin of its face and right hand are visible, and lightly shaded red. The figure is positioned so as to be sitting with its body oriented east, although its face is fully visible and its appears to be holding its head at a diagonal angle, chin pointing toward the hand raised in benediction and eyes focused down on the figure below. </p>
        <p>This second figure is kneeling on the ground at the feet of the first. Its head is raised and chin tilted up. With arms held close to its side and bent at the elbows, it holds up its right hand. The fingers of this hand are extended and the palm is open toward the other figure, perhaps in a gesture of supplication, praise, or greeting. The figure holds a brown horse-shoe shaped object, possibly a hat, in its left hand thereby leaving its head uncovered. The kneeling figure is wearing a knee-length red coat, decorated with brown and blue colored square pieces along the open lower edges above the thighs, over blue leggings. This figure’s hair is yellow and its face a solid pale pink, in contrast to the color and texture of the other figure’s face. Its hand, however, matches the skin tone of the standing figure. </p>
        <p>The figures are positioned so that the one seated on a dais occupies the western half of the image and the one kneeling takes the eastern half. A thick black line drawn vertically from top to bottom splits the stained-glass window in half and connects to a slightly thiner horizontal line bordering the bottom of the glass where the windowpane is set into the wall. Behind the two figures depicted, in the northeastern corner of the window, there appears to be an architectural structure, a gateway of some sort. The rest of the background is composed of indistinguishable shapes of variously colored glass pieces - red, blue, yellow, brown, white, gray. </p>
        <p>The stained-glass window is set in the northwestern corner of a grey wall, which composes about two-thirds the total background area of this image. Two trapezoids outlined in black, appear below and beside the stained-glass window, drawn so as to create a perception of depth suggestive of the area cut into of a thick wall to hold the windowpane. The windowsill below the glass is colored just a slightly paler shade of grey than the surrounding wall, which is also gray. Three thin vertical black lines run parallel the length of the frame down the outer edge of the trapezoid to the east of the window. There is a small triangular object, perhaps an animal head, where these lines end at the southeastern corner of the window unit.  The parallel horizontal lines above and below the Roman numeral “IV” intersect the three vertical lines left of center where the numeral is positioned at the top of the card. </p>
        <p>Just below the “V,” a rectangular space framed by a thin black border occupies nearly the whole northeastern quadrant of the card. It is shaded the same color as the window sill, a slightly paler grey than the surrounding wall. Depicted within the rectangle are line drawings of three swords suspended vertically and hanging parallel to each other, evenly spaced, and pointed down toward the torso and head of a figure lying in repose just below. The swords bear close resemblance to those of the Ace, Two, and Three in size and shape, however differ in that they are uniformly colored grey, exactly the same color as the surrounding rectangular space. </p>
        <p>A male figure is positioned lying on his back with his head resting on a checkered pillow near the eastern border of the image and his legs extending beyond the western border, cut off at the shins. He is dressed elaborately in the armor of a knight. The collar of his gorget is marked with three black dots and visible around his neck. His midsection is encased in a cuirass and, attached to a studded belt around his waist, which is perhaps a faulds, is what appears to be a pleated skirt, or potentially a tasset. His thighs are either exposed or wrapped in a cuisse, and his knees are most certainly protected by poleyns. His shins may be sheathed in greaves, although lack of detail makes it difficult to say definitively. The knight’s left arm is visible and outfitted with a pauldron over the shoulder, secured to a rerebrace covering his upper arm and attached to a couter over his elbow; a vambrace shields his lower arm to the top of the wrist. This arm is bent 90 degrees at the elbow and the back of his bare left hand is held aloft, fingers extended and held close, forming a tent with his other hand (not pictured except for the thin edge of the right hand) over his diaphragm.  He has shoulder length hair and his head is uncovered; eyes and mouth are closed. The figure of the knight is solid yellow with only black shading for effect– his face and hands, or what could be taken as exposed skin, being the same color as his armor – which gives the impression that this is not an actual person but merely a representation, or statue. Additionally, this figure is also the same color as the casket upon which he is lying in repose. </p>
        <p>The figure of the knight appears to be lying on top of the yellow casket lid. Below a line of perpendicular hatch marks denoting the lip of the lid, a relatively thick horizontal black line gives the impression that the casket is open (although no hint of what is or is not inside). Alternating black and yellow lines of varying thickness stretch parallel to this cavernous space, denoting the fittings on the left side of the casket. An engraving of a sword is prominently displayed along the side of the casket visible to the viewer. The sword is placed sideways, parallel to figure lying above. The pommel is aligned with the top of his head, the crossguard with the bridge of his nose, the ricasso with the mouth, and the blade extending from his throat to the top of his shin. The sword is double-edged like the three swords hanging on the wall above the knight, however unlike these swords, the edge closest to the bottom of the card is shaded black (as is the same side of the grip). The rest of the sword is colored the same yellow as the casket (and the knight). The artist’s signature is located, as usual, in the lower right corner of the image; in this case, just below and to the right of the sword’s pommel. </p>
