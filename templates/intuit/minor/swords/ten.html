            The die is cast. The deed is done. The decision is made. Finality in absolutes.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This definiteness also conveys a sense of order. Each point of every sword has effectively been driven home, releasing a stream of vital engery and activating the next sequence of events. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This card offers relief, a sense of moving out of the utter darkness of the Nine of Swords, of night giving way to day. However, the sun rises on a gruesome, though quiet, scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            The blessing of the hierophant in the Four of Swords has come to fruition. The price is paid, the sacrifice made. Go in peace.
