            This card illustrates the moment of awakening to the reality of your bind, of becoming aware of the restrictions holding you back. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Feel the rough cotton blindfold against your eyelids, the pressure of the wrap around your temples, the hardness of the knot at the back of your head. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Become aware of your nakedness beneath the loose, soiled gown. Allow the contradicting sensations of air between your legs and sweat between your breasts to absorb your attention. Inhale and feel the ropes around your body tighten; exhale and experience the slight release. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Extend your awareness left and right. Meet the sharp, cold blades all around you and know that you are the last bar completing the cage that confines you. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Sink your weight into the muddy wasteland of this nightmare scene. As the invisible life of the marsh seeps through your skin and crawls between your toes, accept that you are alone in this dismal morass.   
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now that you know, you can set yourself free. 
        </p>
