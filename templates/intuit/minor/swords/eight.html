            This card illustrates the moment of awakening to the reality of your bind. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Feel the rough cotton blindfold against your eyelids, the pressure as it wraps around your temples, the hardness of the knot on the back of head. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Become aware of your nakedness beneath the loose, soiled gown. Allow the contradicting sensations of air between your legs and sweat between your breasts to absorb your attention. Inhale and feel the ropes tighten around your body; exhale and experience the slight release. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Extend your awareness to meet the sharp, cold blades on your left and right. Know that you are the bar completing the cage that confines you. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Sink your weight into the muddy wasteland of this nightmare scene. As the invisible life of the marsh seeps through your skin and crawls between your toes, accept that you are alone in this dismal morass.   
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now that you know, you can proceed. 
        </p>
