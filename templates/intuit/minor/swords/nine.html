            There is a sense of interiority to this card. Our protagonist is living in a dream within a dream...which is perhaps a living nightmare. He seems acutely distressed.

            The bedside engraving is an enigmatic scene - of a figure reclining beneath a tree, impassive as someone seemingly lunges at him with a sword. It is unclear, however, whether these two are engaged in any way. They could occupy two separate yet parallel dimensions. This suggests the polarity of identity and the integration of duality - the potentiality for peaceful contemplation and lively action coexist.

            I associate the roses with emotional sensitivity, and the signs of the zodiac with the collective unconscious. Both, in this case, are a source of comfort. With our lives we enact the archetypal dramas, gaining insight and wisdom with each new experience. However, we are embedded in a complex matrix of interacting forces that largely determines our capacity to understand and respond. We must act within the scope of our present circumstances, and allow our actions to guide us through the field of being, introducing us to new possibilities along the way.

            The white dress, the night dress, implies purity and vulnerability, and intimates a moment of compunction. This is the moment of recognition which suggests the question: Am I okay? Do I, Can I, accept this aspect of myself newly revealed?

            The wooden bed recalls the coffin in the Four of Swords. Once again, we must confront an ego-death.

            Their presence and position of the swords give the impression that something is hanging in the balance - a decision has to be made.Definitely, a moment of suspense, things waiting to fall into place, or perhaps waiting to fall apart.
