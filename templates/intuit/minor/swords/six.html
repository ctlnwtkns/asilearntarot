            The grey sky and the woman's bowed head contribute a sense of foreboding and heaviness to this image. She seems to be fleeing, going somewhere against her will - somewhere safe but undesirable, knowing it to be in the best interest of her child. It's not a long trip that they're taking, just across the water. They left in a hurry with no time to pack. They will show up on the opposite shore empty-handed but free of a perceived threat.

            The oarsman is a nameless, faceless feature of her trip. He is reliable in his service and his presence in her life goes without question. He is, in affect, an extension of his craft. He performs the purely mechanical function of transitioning her from one side of the river to another. Without him, the boat would be adrift in a sea of purposelessness. He stands, perpetually in motion. He is the active element in this card, navigating the wind, negotiating the waves, moving his ferry from one side of the water to the other.
