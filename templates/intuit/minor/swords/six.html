        The grey sky and the woman's bowed head contribute a sense of foreboding and heaviness to this image. She seems to be leaving a situation and going somewhere against her will but for her safety and in the best interest of her child. It's not a long trip that they're taking, just across the water. They left in a hurry with no time to pack. They will show up on the opposite shore empty-handed.

        The oarsman is a nameless, faceless feature of his passengers' trips. He serves his purpose; he is, in affect, an extension of his craft. He performs the purely mechanical function of transitioning people from one side of the river to another. Without him, the boat would be adrift. He stands, perpetually in motion. He is the active element in this card, navigating the wind, negotiating the waves, moving his ferry from one side of the water to the other.
