##Intro
Creative Anxiety

##Body
###Preparing the Chrysalis
--purchasing candles (yellow for will, purple for wisdom) and incense--lighting my yellow candle. I did not cut the wick, and the flame flared up intensely; I took this to be the ignition of my creative spark. 
--lighting the incense 
--Taking three deep breaths, I could feel the tightness in my abdomen and tension in my shoulders. I continued breathing, trying to slow my racing thoughts and relax my uncomfortable body. 
 
###Anxiety: The effort of calming myself enough to begin 
--From the tension in my gut, pressure in my head, throbbing sinuses, lump in my throat - I felt my throat constrict and was overwhelmed to the point of tears
--I finally had to make the decision to proceed despite not achieving total calm, as the more I focused on the anxiety, the more intense my discomfort became.
--I took my time, as instructed – about 94 minutes total (not accounting for the weeks of agonized mental preparation). 
--The overwhelming expectation that of exploring to “the limits of my conscious awareness.” Allowing myself the option to stop. 
--Self-Censorship, waiting to feel confident, waiting for options, feeling stuck and indecisive, not knowing where to go or what to do, “am I doing it right?”, struggling to allow images to materialize
--afraid of reaching the limit and feeling disappointed 
--Finally, curiousity overcomes self-consciousness

###Directions####Forward
--pentagram 
--vaguely familiar space - pastoral landscape, river, hedge
####Backward
--shift of awareness from mind to body (seeing to feeling), mostly sensations in and around my neck, back, thighs
--feeling sorry for myself that my muscles were so tense. 
--abrupt shift back to seeing, something that invoked a sense of awe and spaciousness
--transitioning to a much more integrated body-mind awareness
####Right
--Unexpectedly encountering people, feeling drawn to embrace them. 
--Feeling surprise, joy, and tenderness (surprising given my antipathy of late)
####Left
--Curiously, auditory 
--etiological basis of words in sound
--words also featured prominently  
--Finally, feeling comfortable
####Above
--rapid succession of images, no apparent connection
####Below
-- Amusement, sexuality, wealth, monsters, and fire. 
####Inward
--Gratitude, loving-tenderness, self-acceptance 
--a winged woman riding a horse over a waterfall (a sort-of pegasus)
##Conclusion
###Reflections
--My mind is full of interesting things! 
--Fear of not being creative enough to come up with anything interesting to see or say. --I buried my treasure and suppressed my generosity (buried room of gold coins)
--I am inherently creative and have access to the heights of imagination (winged woman/horse as self-image)
--I have an expansive desire to connect with other people as an extension of my sense of strength and self-confidence (which actually makes a lot of sense as my sun sign is Aquarius)
--giving myself permission to redefine the terms of the exercise helped mitigate the anxiety 
--Rather than pursuing to completion the ever-expanding, inexhaustible realm of consciousness, allowing myself to stop when I felt I had reached a stopping point
--no end to imagination
--gratitude, gratitude, gratitude --exercise in non-attachment, letting go of my desire for understanding in order to fully engage the process
--allowing images that contradict my self-image to surface and challenge my own expectations

###Pegasus and Temperance--Bellerophon riding Pegasus, “symbolic of the spiritual energy that allows access to the realm of the gods.” 
--how can I form a deeper connection with this energy? 
--Aquarius-sun, wings as movement
--Centaur as Cognitive Dissonance/Personification of Wisdom and said to be symbolic of Sagittarius, my rising sign
--Image search for “winged woman” returns Temperance - integral to engaging my question above - focus on “equanimity” to counteract the anxiety 

###Closing paragraph--Working through creative anxiety 
--greater sense of self-confidence and efficacy
--proof that I am capable 
--a portal of self-actualization

*I generally feel more confident engaging activities that I have wanted but been reluctant to pursue*
