            <h3>Traditional Meanings</h3>
                <h4><i>Regret for the past, fear of the future</i></h4>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li>I believe the sense of foreboding and heaviness I mention in the first sentence echoes this sentiment.
                        </li>
                        <li><i>Regret for the past </i>is fixation on a sense of failure and the futility of wishing something to be other than what it is. <i>Fear of the future</i> is that feeling of dread when you have to do something you do not want to do, or perhaps the anxiety of realizing you are alone in the dark. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           This interpretation seems pretty straightforward and I seem to intuitively agree.  
                        </li>
                    </ol></p>
