            <h1>Four of Swords</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The small pointed face with ears that make it seem not-human is breaking into this somber scene of reflection on the path that led the knight “inevitably” to his death and laughing (not unkindly) at the ego’s high drama. </p>
        <p>Break-through, self-transcendence, absurdity/absurd reality</p>
        <p>This is the release the ego needs to extricate itself from the seemingly unsolvable dilemma. In this case, the knight spent his life fighting for peace. “To live by the sword is to die by the sword.” Peace was an ideal, a vision that inspired him, but a state that he was never able to attain. His life was a paradox. His death is a transition that makes him vulnerable for a revelation. </p>
        <p>Enter this new thing, which seems completely out of place. A disembodied head breaks through from another dimension to offer a new perspective on the present situation, initiating a paradigm shift and also forming a bridge (surprisingly, the head is still attached to its body, which stands on the other side of the Rift).</p>
        <p>It takes one look at the scene spread out before it and starts laughing - laughing and laughing. If the knight is able to get what’s so funny, he will be able to complete the transition, and perhaps attain the unattainable…and/or realize that the ideal he initially sought is only one aspect of the whole.</p>
