        <p>The only figure with his back to the viewer, wearing a polka-dotted tunic, takes an oppositional stance to the group of jousters, embodying defiance in difference. </p>
        <p>This figure is a rarity, an outlier; yet still a part of the group. The polka-dotted tunic is indicates his difference relative to the other tunics, while the boy wearing the tunic does not differ noticeably in shape, build, or color to the others – at least, no more so than any one of them differs from another. </p>
        <p>Angry polka dots speak to the group dynamic that creates conflict: a sense of difference provokes opposition.</p>
        <p>Yet, polka dots are benign, if not a little obscure. </p>
        <p>Difference does not operate outside the group norm, despite its apparent singularity. There is room for individuality within the group. </p>
        <p>For instance, one boy expresses enthusiasm as his desire to belong; another embodies the experience of boredom, the result of feeling obligated to do one’s duty despite lack of desire; a third appears to be intensely focused, concentrating on his movement in his desire to succeed; while next to him, another boy emanates stressful effort, the by-product of his fear of failure. </p>
        <p>Conflict is a group dynamic. </p>
        <p>No one exists outside the group. It is impossible for anyone to do anything that compromises his or her humanity because everything that everyone does expands the definition of what it means to be human. </p>
